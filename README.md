You can find two directory as follows:
1) Experiment_replication
2) Experiment_direction
    a) Transformer models
    b) amount of data affect the learning of irregular past tense forms
    
       

Steps to be added for following topics: 
1) Run following command to install OpenNMT package:
          # !pip install OpenNMT-py    
2) How to preprocess the data so it is in the correct format
         # !onmt_build_vocab -config config-exp1.yaml -n_sample 10000 
4) How to train the models on the data 
5) How to use one of your already trained models to predict unseen data 
6) How to evaluate the output
